## Summary of Python collections
1. **List**: “is a collection which is ordered and changeable (Mutable). Allows duplicate members.”
2. **Tuple**: “is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.”
3. **Set**: “is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.”
4. **Dictionary**: “is a collection which is ordered** and changeable (Mutable). No duplicate members.”

## List
- List is created using square brackets `[]`.
- Each item is separated by a comma `,`.
- Good Python practice: insert a space after each comma.
- Store a combination of different data types.
```python
list = ["String", 27, False, 25.65, [1, 2, 3, 4, "Count"], None]

# Create an empty list
list_empty = []
list_empty = list(())
```

## List Methods / Class
```python
# list_name is our list
# .method() is a method of our list
# This example is for structure illustration,
# it will not work
list_name.method() 
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'method'

# Syntax for List methods
list.method(parameter)
```
